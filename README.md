Musquetteer
===========

An iOS client lib for MQTT based on [Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org), inspired by https://github.com/njh/marquette.
It contains an usage example, that drives leds status using two channels on a MQTT broker.

*TODO*
- add blocks instead of delegate (so pre-arc :-))
- publish to CocoaPod specs
- add error check
- add docs ;-)
