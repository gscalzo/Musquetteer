Musquetteer
===========

An iOS client lib for MQTT based on Mosquitto, inspired by https://github.com/njh/marquette.
It contains an usage example, that drives led status using two channels on a MQTT broker.

*TODO*
- add blocks instead of delegate (sooo pre-arc)
- add CocoaPod spec
- add error check
- add docs ;-)
